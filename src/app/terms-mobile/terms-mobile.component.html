                            can

                            i. The Service allows you to upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your content. You
                            have no
                            obligation to provide any content under these Terms. You can choose the content that you want
                            to
                            provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary
                            rights to
                            do
                            so and that the content is lawful. <br />
                            ii. Your content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights
                            that you
                            have in your content. This is applicable for the content you create or share. For all such
                            content you
                            should have appropriate rights of usage or share. <br />
                            iii. We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your
                            content.
                            You
                            provide us with that permission through this agreement to our Terms of Service. This
                            permission
                            covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property rights. <br />
                            iv. This permission does not affect your privacy rights — it’s only about your intellectual
                            property
                            rights. This also does not cover publicly available factual information and things of common
                            knowledge
                            that everyone can freely use. <br />
                            v. You can use the same content with others also, but we have your permission through these
                            Terms to
                            use

                            use
                            your content — for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from
                            anywhere
                            you
                            go <br />
                            vi. We can publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you’ve made it
                            visible to
                            others. We can modify and create derivative works based on your content, such as reformatting
                            or
                            translating it. We can also sublicense these rights to other users to allow the Services to
                            work as
                            designed or for allowing our associates and third parties to improve the functionalities and
                            for
                            dissemination of our Service. <br />
                            vii. This permission lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property
                            rights.
                            If
                            you remove from our Service any content that’s covered by this Permission, then our systems
                            will stop
                            making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. However, if you already
                            shared
                            your content with others before removing it from our Service, (for example: if you shared a
                            photo with
                            a
                            friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again), then that photo may continue to appear
                            in your
                            friend’s account even after you remove it from your account. <br />

                            Certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction
                            processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to
